#### Advantages of MongoDB over RDBMS:-

- **Schema less** − MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.

- No complex joins.

- Build applications faster, handle highly diverse data types, and manage applications more efficiently at scale.

- **Development is simplified** as MongoDB documents map naturally to modern, object-oriented programming languages. Using MongoDB removes the complex object-relational mapping (ORM) layer that translates objects in code to relational tables. MongoDB’s flexible data model also means that your database schema can evolve with business requirements. MySQL's rigid relational structure adds overhead to applications and slows developers down as they must adapt objects in code to a relational structure.

- MongoDB can also be scaled within and across multiple distributed data centers, providing new levels of availability and scalability previously unachievable with relational databases like MySQL. As your deployments grow in terms of data volume and throughput, MongoDB scales easily with no downtime, and without changing your application. In contrast, achieving scale with MySQL often requires significant custom engineering work.

- MongoDB uses internal memory for storage which enables faster access to the data.

- Because the MongoDB uses JSON format to store data, it is very easy to store arrays and objects.

  

  Summary:- Higher Availability, Faster Development and Scale Infinitely and Cheaply



#### Disadvantages of MongoDB:-

- MongoDB uses high memory for data storage.
- There is a limit for document size, i.e. 16mb.
- There is no transaction support in MongoDB.
