#### Q. import vs require

=> You **can't** selectively load only the pieces you need with `require` but with `import`, you can selectively load only the pieces you need. *That can save memory.*

Loading is **synchronous**(step by step) for `require` on the other hand `import` can be asynchronous(without waiting for previous import) so it *can perform a little better than* `require`
