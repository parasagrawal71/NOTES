Fragments:- 

A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.   

Example,   
```react
return (
    < React.Fragment>
      < ChildA />
      < ChildB />
      < ChildC />
    < /React.Fragment>
  );
        
Short syntax,
<>
  < ChildA />
  < ChildB />
  < ChildC />
< />
```


Some Code Quality checkers inside the editor can throw an error saying this short syntax (<></>) is not valid.   
So, React.Fragment is preferable.
