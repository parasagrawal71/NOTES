Each folder contain one or more project folders that contains the code that I have tried while learning that language or technology.   
It also contains the links or any notes related to that language, or framework, etc.   
It also has separate folder for each courses.   

FOLLOW This (starting with small letter):   
	1. Write the project folder name same as language name. Example, kotlin.   
	2. Write the App or Package name as [language name]+"Learning". Example, kotlinLearning (if capital letter is not allowed as in react, write as reactlearning).   
	3. In React Native, write package idenifier or bundle identifier name as com.learning.reactNative. Similarly in other languages.
