Each folder contains one root folder containing one or more project folders that has the code that I have tried while learning.   
It also contains the links or any notes related to that language, or library, or framework, etc.   
It also has separate folder for each courses.   

FOLLOW this (starting with small letter):   
1. Write the project folder name same as language name. Example, kotlin.   
2. Write the App or Package name as [language name]+"Learning". Example, kotlinLearning (if capital letter is not allowed as in react, write as reactlearning).   
	1. If 2nd project is required, write name as [language name]+"Learning1". Example, reactlearning1.	
	2. If project folder contains one more folder which has same name as package name, place 2nd project in same root folder(Check react folder inside React and Redux).	
	3. If project folder does not contain one more folder, make one root folder for containing this project and 2nd project that will have same name as [language name].	
	4. App/package name can be [language name]+"Learning"+"-"+"something related to project". Example, reactlearning1-streams.			
3. In React Native, write package idenifier or bundle identifier name as com.learning.reactNative. Similarly in other languages.
