**In  JavaScript ,  functions are first-class objects, which means they can be:**

- stored in a variable.
- passed as an argument to a function.
- returned from a function.
- Be stored in some data structure; and,
- Hold their own properties and methods.

NOTE:  JavaScript, for all of its power and expressiveness, is a language that **refuses categorization**. Some prefer to use it in the object-oriented style and others in the functional style. And the mere fact that it can be used in either tells us something about JavaScriptâ€™s dynamism.

##### Uses of a First-Class Function:-

- Higher-Order Functions
- Partial Function Application
- Asynchronous Functions
