#### Advantages:-

- Non-blocking

- I/O Operations (Sync and Async)

- Same language for back-end as well as front-end:- Saves time, Easy to learn and consumes less time to work with it.

- Known for Offering High Performance

  It has been mentioned earlier that Node.js interprets the JavaScript code via Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. This engine complies the JavaScript code directly into the machine code. This makes it easier and faster to implement the code in a effective manner.

  The speed of the code execution also enhanced by runtime environment as it supports the non-blocking I/O operations.

- Large and active community of developers

- Node.js also provides the facility of caching single modules

- The developers can get an extended support for the various commonly used tools. if you want to identify and install the project dependencies, you can make use of npm, a powerful package manager.

- Handles the Requests Simultaneously

  Since the Node.js is providing the option of non-blocking I/O systems, it relatively helps you to process several requests concurrently.

- Node.js is Highly Extensible

  The Node.js is known to be highly extensible, which means that you can customize and further extend Node.js as per their requirements.

- Real-time applications

- Building Cross-Platform Applications (libuv makes the nodejs compatible with all OS)

- **Aynchronous and Event Driven** - All APIs of Node.js library are aynchronous that is non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for a API to return data. Server moves to next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps server to get response from the previous API call.

- **Very Fast** - Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.

- **Single Threaded but highly Scalable** - Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps server to respond in a non-bloking ways and makes server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single threaded program and same program can services much larger number of requests than traditional server like Apache HTTP Server.

- **No Buffering** - Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
